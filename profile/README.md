## About BAY

<p align="justify">Bread & Yolk (BAY) is a cybersecurity research group founded in 2022 in Jakarta, Indonesia. We combine business innovation with community-driven research, education, and collaboration to advance the security field.</p>

Our work is divided into two main service areas:
- Blue Anvil — delivering DFIR exercise, tabletop exercises, and cyber drills to help organizations assess and strengthen their resilience.
- Hacksmiths — providing high-quality Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and event support for learning, training, and competition.

Beyond services, BAY actively contributes to the global security community through:
1. Presentations at international conferences such as Black Hat.
2. Development of DFIR tools and malware simulation projects for defensive testing.
3. Publishing educational articles and research on Medium.

<p align="justify">BAY exists to support and empower the cybersecurity community. We are driven not by profit, but by purpose — fostering collaboration, education, and innovation in an ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>

<p align="justify">Plaguards is a powerful security tool that automates deobfuscation of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, helping teams quickly identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and distinguish valid threats from false positives. Each analysis produces a detailed PDF report with actionable insights.</p>

<p align="justify">As a web app, Plaguards enables flexible, on-demand analysis from anywhere, making it invaluable for blue teams handling complex malware. It supports DFIR by improving investigation scope and attribution, efficiently processing large volumes of data to reveal malware TTPs and guide analysts to key artifacts—speeding up root cause analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">For SOC teams, Plaguards reduces response time to critical alerts by quickly deobfuscating suspicious scripts, allowing faster investigation and enriched alert reports with IOC lookups, helping meet tight SLA requirements.</p>
