## About BAY

<p align="justify">Bread & Yolk (BAY) is a cybersecurity research group founded in 2022 in Jakarta, Indonesia. We combine business innovation with community-driven research, education, and collaboration to advance the security field.</p>

Our work is divided into two main service areas:
- Blue Anvil — delivering tabletop exercises and cyber drills to help organizations assess and strengthen their resilience.
- Hacksmiths — providing high-quality Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and event support for learning, training, and competition.

Beyond services, BAY actively contributes to the global security community through:
1. Presentations at international conferences such as Black Hat.
2. Development of DFIR tools and malware simulation projects for defensive testing.
3. Publishing educational articles and research on Medium.

<p align="justify">BAY exists to support and empower the cybersecurity community. We are driven not by profit, but by purpose — fostering collaboration, education, and innovation in an ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>
