## About BAY

<p align="justify">Bread & Yolk (BAY) is a cybersecurity research group founded in 2022 in Jakarta, Indonesia. We combine business innovation with community-driven research, education, and collaboration to advance the security field.</p>

Our work is divided into two main service areas:
🔹 Blue Anvil — delivering tabletop exercises and cyber drills to help organizations assess and strengthen their resilience.
🔹 Hacksmiths — providing high-quality Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and event support for learning, training, and competition.

Beyond services, BAY actively contributes to the global security community through:
1. Presentations at international conferences such as Black Hat.
2. Development of DFIR tools and malware simulation projects for defensive testing.
3. Publishing educational articles and research on Medium.

<p align="justify">As a non-profit collective, BAY exists to support and empower the cybersecurity community. We are driven not by profit, but by purpose — fostering collaboration, education, and innovation in an ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>

<p align="justify">Plaguards is a powerful security tool that automates deobfuscation of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, helping teams quickly identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and distinguish valid threats from false positives. Each analysis produces a detailed PDF report with actionable insights.</p>

<p align="justify">As a web app, Plaguards enables flexible, on-demand analysis from anywhere, making it invaluable for blue teams handling complex malware. It supports DFIR by improving investigation scope and attribution, efficiently processing large volumes of data to reveal malware TTPs and guide analysts to key artifacts—speeding up root cause analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">For SOC teams, Plaguards reduces response time to critical alerts by quickly deobfuscating suspicious scripts, allowing faster investigation and enriched alert reports with IOC lookups, helping meet tight SLA requirements.</p>

<p align="justify">JARY is a runtime for creating .jary rules to search and correlate log data from external sources. It allows users to define structured rules that filter, match, and analyze log entries to support data analysis and automation. The JARY runtime is a lightweight library written in C that can be dynamically linked with other programs. It provides functions to compile JARY rules, feed data into the runtime, and execute the rules, all accessible from a single library through function calls. The .jary rule syntax is derived from the YARA language developed by VirusTotal.</p>
